# MTBLogger
This is a simple web application I created to get some familiarity with ASP.NET MVC. I am using C#, .NET Core 5.0, Entity Framework, and SQL Server for the database.

The functionality of this application currently is very simple, it is as follows:
  - Logs a list of trails that you've ridden
  - Log a list of trails that you would like to ride in the future

This application uses CRUD for persistent stoarage.
